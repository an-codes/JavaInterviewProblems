Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort is not the fastest of the sorting algorithms because it has to use nested loops which take a lot of time.
It is still useful, but on smaller data sets.


			|   BEST   |   WORST
Iteration   |   O(n)   |   O(n)
Shift Items |   O(1)   |   O(n)
Total       |   O(n)   |   O(n^2)
