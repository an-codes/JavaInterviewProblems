What is a square root?
Square root of X is a number that gives X when multiplied by itself.
E.g., Square root of 25 is 5, because 5*5=25.

Java already has a function that calculates that ( Math.sqrt(number) ), but this projects attempts to create its own square root method by using Newton's Method.
