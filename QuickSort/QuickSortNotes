Quick Sort:

Like Merge Sort, QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways. 

1. Always pick the first element as a pivot.
2. Always pick the last element as a pivot (implemented below)
3. Pick a random element as a pivot.
4. Pick median as the pivot.

It is implemented as an "in place" sorting algorithm as it does not require any additional place to store the sub-arrays. e.g. Merge-sort is a 'not-in-place' algorithm, so it has worse space complexity
Partition - a process in which we select a pivot and rearrange a list.
