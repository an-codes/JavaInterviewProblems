Interpolation meaning:
"the insertion of something of a different nature into something else"


Similar to binary search, interpolation search can only work on a sorted array.
On top of that and not alike the binary search, the array has to be uniformly distributed.
That means that a difference between i and i+1, i+1 and 1+2 and so on must be either the same or very similar.


Baeldung says:
"It places a probe in a calculated position on each iteration. If the probe is right on the item we are looking for, the position will be returned; otherwise, the search space will be limited to either the right or the left side of the probe."
