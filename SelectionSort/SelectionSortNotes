Step-By-Step Approach (by GeeksForGeeks):

1. Initialize minimum value(min_idx) to location 0
2. Traverse the array to find the minimum element in the array
3. While traversing if any element smaller than min_idx is found then swap both the values.
4. Then, increment min_idx to point to next element
5. Repeat until array is sorted
